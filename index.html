                    <h3>Methods</h3>
                    <p>On the one hand, we conducted a questionnaire survey. The survey targeted approximately 54 college students of various grades and genders. As personal consumption habits, gender, and dining experiences can influence one's understanding and awareness of food safety issues around the campus, the questionnaire investigated participants' dining habits, gender, attention to food safety, common sense questions, etc. Data was collected and analyzed using chart analysis to analyze the percentage of people encountering food problems around the campus and the main factors affecting college students' food safety awareness. This provides an entry point for better understanding college students' food safety awareness. On the other hand, we conducted offline interviews with people of different grades to understand their views and attitudes towards food safety around the campus. We encouraged them to offer their own opinions and suggestions on how to achieve food safety, making food safety policies more in line with college students' ideas and improving the food safety factor around the campus.

                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>With the rapid development of the times and the progress of science and technology, people are also paying more attention to food safety, but because the process of food processing cannot be directly observed, there are often acts of cutting corners and even counterfeiting  this topic will focus on the general perception and attitude of college students towards food around campus. We will be looking at different types of college students including different grades, different genders, etc. We will use questionnaires and interviews with some students to obtain students' understanding of the food around the campus, as well as their attitudes towards the surrounding environment and related problems

                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <div class="image-container">
                    <p>the majority of students are concerned about food safety issues around campus and pay attention to information such as production dates and shelf life when purchasing food. When encountering food safety problems, students tend to reflect to the merchants or report to the school. In terms of environmental hygiene, garbage accumulation and noise disturbance are common issues, 
                        and students suggest strengthening supervision and regular cleaning to improve the situation.</p>

                        <h3>discussions</h3>
                        <p>In terms of consumer awareness and behavior, there is uneven attention paid to food safety. It is necessary to strengthen education and promotion to guide consumers in paying attention to food information and developing good consumption habits.

                            When it comes to addressing food safety issues, while many people will actively provide feedback when encountering problems, some still choose to endure them. Feedback channels should be optimized to encourage the protection of rights. Secondly, as most issues are attributed to merchants, regulatory departments should strengthen targeted supervision, inspection, training, and punishment.
                            
                            Regarding environmental hygiene, the surrounding environment has received poor evaluations with numerous problems. Multi-department collaboration is required for remediation, strengthening management and maintenance.
                            
                            Comprehensive consideration should be given to suggestions from all parties to formulate long-term remediation plans and create a favorable environment.
